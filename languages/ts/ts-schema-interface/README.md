# Arri Schema Interface

An experimental exploration into what a universal validator interface for arri might look like. Inspired by [standard-schema](https://github.com/standard-schema/standard-schema).

The idea is that perhaps others could implement this interface and would be able to use alongside `@arrirpc/server`
